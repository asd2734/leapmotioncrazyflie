The point of this project was to create an intuitive interface for controlling a quadcopter. We achieved this using a Leap Motion sensor device and by using it to detect hand motion, we were able to map appropriate controls onto our Crazyflie Nano quadcopter.

The Crazyflie Nano quadcopter allows for six degrees of freedom: the three translational (x, y, and z) and three rotational (pitch, yaw, and roll) motions. Our program looks for those motions in the user's hand and scales them so that controls are fluid, yet stable.
